#: inc/admin/about.php:27
msgid "Dones is not a typical WordPress theme, and isn’t intended to be used for your company’s marketing page or your personal blog. Rather, Dones is an application to help you and your team manage and record the progress of your tasks and projects. It serves as a running record of your team’s goals and accomplishments. It is not too much unlike a to-do list (or a <em>dones</em> list, if you will). With an emphasis on collaboration, tagging, and aggregating, Dones helps organize and keep your team in sync."

#. translators: About page refer to add users

#: inc/admin/about.php:43
msgid "To start using Dones, begin by <a href=\"%s\">adding user accounts</a> for each member of your team, assigning any user role with permission to create posts (Contributor or above). Newly created users will appear automatically on the front page of your site. Once they have logged in, members of your team can immediately start adding new \"dones\" to record their progress."

#: inc/admin/about.php:74
msgid "The Dones theme does not include any features to turn your site private, so anyone can view your history if you choose to host your site publicly. It’s up to you to decide how to authorize visitors to your site. You may choose to host the site on an internal network, configure your web server to implement <a href=\"%1$s\">basic authentication</a>, or <a href=\"%2$s\">search for a plugin</a> that provides privacy options as a feature. See <strong><a href=\"%3$s\">Tip: Private Site</a></strong> for more information."
